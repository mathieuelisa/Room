# ROOM Website

## The project

"ROOM" is my first project I realised as an autodidact.<br>
At the first I wanted to practice on HTML and CSS as well as Javascript by re-editing from scratch an integration page allowing to practice. <br><br>
After taking up this challenge, I quickly wanted to deep my knowledge by upgrading this site by changing its presentation page, by creating a contact page as well as a "about page".

## Design ðŸ”§

The design was made using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/xd.html)
<br><br>

## Deployment

I implemented <strong>Node JS</strong> to the project in order to get and manage a database for my form.
